    Perfect!. Now you can decide which 'bypasser(s)' do you want to use:


        1)- I want to inject XSS scripts without any encoding.


        2)- Try to inject code using 'Hexadecimal'.


        3)- Try to inject code mixing 'String.FromCharCode()' and 'Unescape()'.


        4)- I want to create 'Character Encoding Mutations'. 


        5)- I don't know exactly what is a 'bypasser'... But I want to inject code! :-)
