    Now, you need to select which class of connection(s) do you want to make with your target(s):

           
        1)- I will connect using GET to a payload.


        2)- I will connect using POST to a payload.


        3)- I want to "crawl" all links of my target(s) to found as much vulnerabilities as possible.


        4)- I don't know how to connect... Just do it! :-)
