    Do you want to be as much 'anonymous' as possible?:

 
        1)- Yes. I want to use my own proxy and apply automatic spoofing methods.


        2)- Anonymous?. Yes!!!. I have a -transparent- TOR proxy listening on: http://127.0.0.1:8118. 
   

        3)- Yes. But, I haven't any proxy. :-)

   
        4)- No. It's not a problem to connect directly to the target(s).
